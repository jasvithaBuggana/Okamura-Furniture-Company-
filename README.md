## Okamura Furniture Company- Production Optimization Project

## Overview

This project focuses on collecting and analyzing production quantity data for Okamura Furniture Company, specifically targeting the optimization of overall profits from a new production warehouse at the Tsukuba Plant over the next two quarters using Solver in Microsoft excel.

## Problem Statement

**Background:**
Okamura Corporation, a prominent Japanese furniture manufacturer, is expanding a new production warehouse at the Tsukuba Plant to meet the increasing demand for office furniture. The product line includes chairs, desks, tables, storage solutions, and partitions, known for their unique designs and ergonomic features.

**Objective:**
The goal is to analyze the production quantity of different products, namely Chair-Portone, Work Pods Drape, and Conference Table, to maximize overall profits from the specific plant for the next two quarters.

## Project Details

1. **Construction and Opening:**
   - The new plant is under construction and is scheduled to open in August 2023.
   - Operations will commence in November 2023.

2. **Product Research:**
   - Focused on three best-selling products: Chair-Portone, Work Pods Drape, and Conference Table.
   - Each product requires varying fabrication hours, assembly hours, and manufacturing hours.
   - Raw materials include melamine, ocean recycled plastic, and die-cast aluminum.

3. **Optimization Recommendations:**
   - After analyzing the data, the project recommends trying wood as a substitute for melamine, with a slight reduction in the selling price.
   - This strategic move aims to enhance overall profits by optimizing the choice of raw materials without compromising product quality.

## Recommendations

Based on the observations, we can suggest considering the use of wood instead of melamine for certain products, accompanied by a modest reduction in the selling price. This strategic shift aims to achieve a balance between cost efficiency and maintaining product quality.
